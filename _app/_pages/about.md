# Why  
<br>
The cornerstone of staying healthy is taking your meds‚Äî*every day*. But they don‚Äôt make it easy. Prior authorizations, different formularies, substitutions, new insurance, new job, new state, deductibles, specialist referrals.  

Pharmr was built by patients like you to put you in charge of your own scripts and care. Long term drug therapy is a different beast from diagnosis or initial treatment, so it‚Äôs time we do it differently. 

We've put pro level health tools in the hands of chronic care patients. We only ask that you to check in regularly, be honest, and when stuff gets weird, you chat with your assigned provider right away. That‚Äôs the bargain. 

Otherwise, **happy cruising üèÑ**.

# FAQ 
<br>
**How much does it cost?**  
All protocols are monthly subscriptions that range from $10-$30/month + the cost of drugs. You can cancel or restart at any time.  

**Can I use insurance?**  
You can! Though we‚Äôre initially focusing on the cash payers experience. All protocol subscriptions are by credit card only (no insurance reimbursement), though you may use your insurance for drug fulfillment. 

**My therapy or condition isn‚Äôt listed**  
The hard thing about launching a platform is the initial content. We‚Äôre working on it! If you have suggestions or particular requests send us a note here at mailto:treatmentrequests@pharmr.com or make a post on our Reddit [r/Pharmr](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pharmr/) 

**Do I need a prior diagnosis?**  
In most cases yes, but it‚Äôs up to the individual protocol physician. Some diagnoses can be made as a clinical decision via telehealth, while others require more thorough examination or testing. 

**I‚Äôm a provider and want to sign up**  
Awesome. Read about the process [here](https://cranky-johnson-407f0c.netlify.app/providers/) and let‚Äôs link up. 

**Is self management dangerous?**   
In a word, no. [Assisted self management](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103232/) is the cornerstone of chronic care. We just brought it online. However, if you‚Äôre uncomfortable having lightweight interactions with a provider, require frequent hospitalizations or lots of support, or don‚Äôt feel comfortable managing your condition virtually, this platform is not for you. 

**What pharmacies do you support?**  
Technically, we support all pharmacies that allow for digital prescribing (ie e-prescribe). A newer generation of pharmacy exists that are api driven and integrated directly into our platform. When you place your order, your money will be held immediately and your request shipped right away if prescribed. This cuts down significantly on administrative work for the patient. We call this **instant fill**. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs only supported by a small number of pharmacies at the moment. To access the rest, choose the ‚ÄúFill on my own‚Äù option or FOMO to send a legacy prescription to a pharmacy of your choosing. You‚Äôll be responsible for paying for the drugs yourself as well as shipping or local pickup. Bear in mind, with the FOMO option, there may be extreme variability in drug pricing and insurance benefits coverage and we cannot gaurenteed a particular price. 

**I take a scheduled drug. Can I still use Pharmr?**  
At the momement no, but we plan to support this in the future. Controlled substances require additional logic and rules around how their handled (particularly in regards to refills, transfers and delivery).   

**Is Pharmr a pharmacy or a medical practice?**  
Neither. Pharmr is a technology platform that connects chronic care patients to physicians and pharmacies. 

**What is maintenance or continuation therapy?**  
Maintenance drugs are medications prescribed to treat chronic, long-term conditions and are taken on a
regular,recurring basis. Examples of maintenance drugs are those used to treat ADHD, asthma, diabetes, HIV, or Crohn's Disease. A larger list can be found [here](https://member.carefirst.com/carefirst-resources/pdf/2019-maintenance-drug-list-sum2723.pdf)  

**This is cool üß¨. How can I help?**  
We need the following super talented people to help us deliver our vision:  
- UI developer (React web applications)  
- Head of operations  
- Business development (Pharmaceutical/biotech)  
- Customer service agent 1  
- Cartoon illustrator (Preferably someone who works on Adult Swim)  
- Machine learning developer (Tensorflow)  
- Patient outreach social media represenatative

# Pharmr makes it easy to get, reorder, request and switch between drugs of similar classes. So you can cruise indefinitly on your lispro, humira or bycktarvy and never miss a dose.  

## How it works

1. Find your protocol and subscribe  
2. Get meds and have them shipped to you  
3. Periodically check in  
4. Ask medical questions when they come up
5. Keep cruising

# The point of Pharmr is so you never run out. Becuause you're critical meds are as important as air, food or water. But CVS doesn't give a shit if you do.

## Vision  

Pharmr is about putting pro healthcare tools in the hands of chronic care patients so they can self manage and have more time to do other shit.
