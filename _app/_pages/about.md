# Being sick sucks.  

### Pharma makes it easy to manage your maintaince or continuation therapy online; get, refill, reorder and easily switch between drugs of the same class. Each protocol run by a specialist who intimately knows your condition and medications. So you can cruise indefinitely on your Humira, Byktarvi or Lispro without ever missing a beat.  

## How it works  

Find your protocol and subscribe
Get meds and have them shipped to you
Check in occasionally
Ask your doctor questions as they arise
Keep cruising 

## Why 

The cornerstone of staying healthy is taking your shit-everyday. But they don‚Äôt make it easy.  Prior authorizations, different formulated, substitutions, new insurance, new job, new state, specialist referrals. 

Pharmr was built by patients like you to put you in charge of your own scripts and care. Long term drug therapy is a different beast from diagnosis or initial treatment, so it‚Äôs time we do it differently. 

We put pro level health tools in the hands of patients. We only ask that you to check in occasionally, be honest, and when stuff gets weird, you chat with one of our doctors right away. That‚Äôs the bargain. 

Otherwise, Happy cruising üèÑ

## FAQ 

### How much does it cost
All protocols are monthly subscriptions that range from $10-$30/month (depending on complexity) + the cost of drugs. 

### Can I use insurance
You can! Though we‚Äôre initially focusing on the cash payers experience. All protocol subscriptions are by credit card only (no insurance reimbursement), though you may use your insurance for drug fulfillment. 

### My therapy or condition isn‚Äôt listed
The hard thing about launching a platform is the initial content. We‚Äôre working on it! If you have suggestions or particular requests send us a note here: request@pharmr.com or make a post on our Reddit r/Pharmr 

### Do I need a prior diagnosis?
In most cases yes, but It‚Äôs up to the individual protocol physician. some diagnoses can be made as a clinical decisions via telehealth, while others require more thorough examination or testing. 

### I‚Äôm a provider and want to sign up
Awesome. Read about the process here and  let‚Äôs link up. 

### Is self management dangerous 
In a word, no. Assisted self management is the cornerstone of chronic care. We just brought it online. However, if you‚Äôre uncomfortable having lightweight interactions with a provider, require frequent hospitalizations or lots of support, or don‚Äôt feel comfortable managing your condition virtually, this platform is not for you. 

### What pharmacies do you support
Technically, we support all pharmacies that allow for digital prescribing (ie e-prescribe). A newer generation of pharmacy exists that are api driven and integrated directly into our platform. When you place your order, your money will be held immediately and your request shipped right away if prescribed. This cuts down significantly on administrative work for the patient. We call this **instant fill**. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs only supported by a small number of pharmacies at the moment. To access the rest, choose the ‚ÄúFill on my own‚Äù option or FOMO to send a legacy prescription to a pharmacy of your choosing. You‚Äôll be responsible for paying for the drugs yourself as well as shipping or local pickup. Bear in mind, with the FOMO option, there may be extreme variability in drug pricing and insurance benefits coverage because ‚Äî- well, this is America!

### Is Pharmr a pharmacy 
No. Pharmr is a technology platform that connects chronic care patients to physicians and pharmacies. 

### This is cool. How can I help?
We need the following super talented people to help us deliver our vision:
UI developer- react web apps 
Head of operations
Business development - pharmaceutical/biotech 
Customer service agent 1 
Cartoon illustrator - preferably someone who works on Adult Swim 
Machine learning developer - tensorflow 
Social media something something
