# Being sick sucks. Managing your drug therapy doesn't have to.  

# Pharmr makes it easy to get, reorder, request and switch between drugs of similar classes. So you can cruise indefinitly on your lispro, humira or bycktarvy and never miss a dose.  

## How it works

1. Find your protocol and subscribe  
2. Get meds and have them shipped to you  
3. Periodically check in  
4. Ask medical questions when they come up
5. Keep cruising

# The point of Pharmr is so you never run out. Becuause you're critical meds are as important as air, food or water. But CVS doesn't give a shit if you do.

## Vision  

Pharmr is about putting pro healthcare tools in the hands of chronic care patients so they can self manage and have more time to do other shit.
