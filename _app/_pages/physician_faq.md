# Frequently Asked Questions   

**How do you manage patient insurance?**  
Pharmr's base subscription is for cash paying patients only as explicility stated in our terms. Insurance can be used for the cost of drugs though. Providers, at their own descretion, determine what what they will and won't support in regards to insurance reimburesment for medication sin their protocol description.  

**What patient population are we treating and are there any limits?**  
Currently, Pharmr only supports US based patients with valid photo IDs between the ages of 18 and <65. When you create an account, will be asked to complete an account profile that asks for all your state licenses. You will only be able to see patients in states you are licensed to practice. Generally speaking, you should not onboard patients who require (high touch care), frequent hospitalizations, or those conditions unsuitable for telehealth.  

**I plan on growing my practice with Pharmr. Do you support delegate accounts (i.e. additional providers, or PAs, RNs, MAs etc)?**  
Yes, a protocol creator may assign additional physicians to work on the platform on their behalf. We plan on supporting non-physican delegates soon.  

**How do I interact with my patients?**  
Pharmr currently supports 3 means of patient interaction:  
  -A-sync survery responses  
  -Direct messaging (text and file attachments)  
  -Video calling (via Doxy.me or another HIPAA compliant 3rd party platform)  
  
**Can I prescribe scheduled drugs?**  
Not currently.  

**I want to make my own microservice. How specific does it have to be?**
(This answer is currently terrrible!!!) Micoservices are intended to be very specific: A single condition + a single class of theraputics (e.g. mild intermittent asthma + beta-2 agonisits). In some cases, it may make sense to include multiple conditions or drug classes into a single microservice. The rule being, if there is expected overlap in treatments in a given patient population, you should include both treatments (e.g. mild intermitten astha, mild to moderate persistant asthma + beta-2 agonists, ICS & ICS/LABA).  

**Do I need my own malpractice insurance?**  
Pharmr has the same liabilty protections as Teledoc. Yes, you will need your own medmal coverage. Pharmr will provide cyber, general liability & and an umbrella policy for it's providers. Providers may purchase higher rates of coverage if they so choose.
